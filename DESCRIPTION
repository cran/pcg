Description: The package solves linear system of equations Ax=b by using Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Algorithm where A is real symmetric positive definite matrix. A suitable preconditioner matrix may be provided by user. This can also be used to minimize quadratic function (x'Ax)/2-bx for unknown x.
